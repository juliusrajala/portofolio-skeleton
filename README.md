#Portofolio-skeleton

This folder is intended as a work-in-progress base for future website projects. The project includes a small node-server that serves the files for local work and testing.

##Installation

Obviously npm and nodejs are required dependencies. On top of these, you'll want to have the following node modules installed:
- Bootstrap
- Express
- Path
- React

I'd run this using nodemon as well, it makes it easier to see your file changes real time.
